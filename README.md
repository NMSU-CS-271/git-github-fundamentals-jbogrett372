A lot of my confusion with GitHub stems from never having used it before.  I think with due time and practice commiting, pushing, and taking other actions, I will be more capable of using GitHub.  I think of a repository as my own copy of a folder which contains files, programs, etc.  I also think of it as when I and others edit the repository, we can then commit our versions of the same "main" version of that repository, which enables  people to work on the same project.  All in all, I take it that the main purpose of GitHub is to simplify project collaboration and handle projects safely so as to prevent any unwanted modifications.
